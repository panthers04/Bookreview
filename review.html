						<br><br><i>“Once upon a time, there was a boy. Once upon a time there was a mother. Once upon a
							time, there was a boy, and his mother loved him very much.”</i><br><br>It has been over ten
						years since the “Crisis” - a period of economic decline - failing businesses, unemployment,
						poverty and lawlessness - a period of chaos that was attributed to being the result of the
						manipulations of an Asian country that was thriving during the same period. In the interest of
						boosting the economy and preserving American culture, PACT -“The Preserving American Culture and
						Traditions Act”- has been passed allowing for reporting and arrest of those perceived to be
						“anti –American” and children from families perceived to be guilty of the same have been
						relocated to state-approved homes and foster families. Books viewed as teaching un-American
						values have been removed from schools and libraries (destroyed and pulped, recycled into toilet
						paper as opposed to being burnt!- <i>“Much more civilized, right?</i>”), certain websites have
						been blocked, web searches are censored and hate crimes are on the rise.<br><br>It has been
						three years since twelve-year-old Noah “Bird” Gardner has seen his mother, well-known poet
						Chinese-American poet Margaret Miu. Over the last three years Noah and his father Ethan, former
						faculty in Linguistics and currently employed in the University Library, have kept their head
						down, avoiding attention and dissociating themselves from Margaret, whose lines from her books
						of poems “Our The Missing Hearts “ was adopted by anti –PACT activists as their slogan, branding
						her a “traitor” in the eyes of the authorities. Given the intense Anti-Asian sentiment and
						discrimination and increasing incidents of violence directed toward East Asians, Bird, who is
						biracial, is encouraged by his father to hide his Asian roots. When Bird receives a letter with
						drawings reminiscent of the folktales his mother used to tell him, he embarks on a search for
						his missing mother- a journey that provides him not only with a greater understanding of his
						mother and her life as well as insight into the reasons behind his mother’s disappearance but
						also gives him an honest unfiltered perspective on the reality of the world around him. Needless
						to say, Bird’s journey as he struggles with his feelings about his mother –his hurt and longing
						for her gradually evolves into a deeper understanding of his parents’ love for him and a shift
						in his worldview - is a difficult and emotional one.<br><br>Poignant, heartbreaking, disturbing
						and thought-provoking, <b>Our Missing Hearts</b> by <b>Celeste Ng </b>is a beautifully –written,
						powerful and timely novel that revolves around themes of family, love, sacrifice and racially
						motivated injustice. I finished reading this book two days ago and it’s taken me this long to
						gather my thoughts and pen a coherent review. This is not an easy book to read and even more
						difficult to review. The author paints a dark and dystopian picture of a nation where
						discrimination, racism and injustice are justified in the name of preservation of economic
						stability, culture and values. Families have been torn apart, innocent children have been
						forcibly taken from their homes and those working to change the narrative , build awareness and
						reunite families with their “missing hearts” are constantly putting their lives on the line -
						activists who openly protest and those who are covertly networking to trace those who been lost.
						The larger part of the narrative is shared from Bird’s perspective, though we do get to hear the
						voices of other characters as well. Unfortunately, unlike many dystopian novels, much about this
						book feels a bit too real at times. The author draws inspiration from past and current events
						which she discusses in a brilliantly penned Author’s Note. This story left me with a heavy
						heart.<br><br><i>“When are you ever done with the story of someone you love? You turn the most
							precious of your memories over and over, wearing their edges smooth, warming them again with
							your heat. You touch the curves and hollows of every detail you have, memorizing them,
							reciting them once more though you already know them in your bones. Who ever thinks,
							recalling the face of the one they loved who is gone: yes, I looked at you enough, I loved
							you enough, we had enough time, any of this was enough?”</i>
